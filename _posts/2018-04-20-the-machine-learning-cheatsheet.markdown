Lately, I spent some time on various data science projects: predictive analysis, natural language processing, graph analysis, etc.

Behind the scene, **they all share the same machine learning algorithms**. Of course, those models barely represent 10 lines of code in my notebooks, thanks to the wonderful open-source libraries accessible today. 

But I wanted to go back to the basics and offer a clear picture of **how machine learning works, under the hood**.

# The project

  The idea with this project is to create a **simple, concise, potentially exhaustive document about the most common machine learning algorithms**.
  
 **A cheatsheet one could come back to for a quick read**, in case of doubt or just to keep things clear.
  
  This cheatsheet focus on **how algorithms work**: the learning, the predictions, the representation or even the expected inputs. I also added a few business oriented usecases, in order to show the usability of those methods.
  
But coding is not included in the document, as I consider it highly dependent on the chosen language and library. Furnished documentations often constitute a good, comprehensive knowledge base.

Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning methods are also not present here, as they surely  require their own cheatsheets.

# What it looks like

The Machine Learning Cheatsheet is a 5-pages document that can be found [on my github](https://github.com/remicnrd/ml_cheatsheet).

This cheatsheet is meant to be a constant work in progress, so please feel free to contact me for any possible improvement!
